Description goes here

TODO: 

1) History has problems

- arriving on page (for multiple tables) adds entry for every table
- need to add current page when sorting or paging, as otherwise you get taken
  to the previous but one page / table

2) No Search

3) No Components, check out widgets:

svn: http://progrium.com/svn/vforge/plugins/widgets

4) When no actions are defined no end border is drawn on right of row

USAGE:

The following class produces 2 tables for the models users and reports 

:suffix => true - this creates methods with the model name as a suffix and
                  the table name as model_table. use for multiple tables in a controller
:rows_per_page  - number of rows on a page
:except         - don;t make these methods

class TestController < ApplicationController
  
  ajax_scaffold :user, :rows_per_page => 4, :suffix => true
  ajax_scaffolf :report, :except => ['edit', 'delete'], :suffix => true
  
  @@report_scaffold_columns = [ 
        AjaxScaffold::ScaffoldColumn.new(Report, { :name => "title",
          :eval => "row.current_definition.title", :sort_sql => 'method:current_definition.title'}),
        AjaxScaffold::ScaffoldColumn.new(Report, { :name => "last run", 
          :eval => "row.last_report_run.run_at", :sort_sql => 'method:last_report_run.run_at' }),
        AjaxScaffold::ScaffoldColumn.new(Report, { :name => "run", 
          :eval => "row.runs", :sort_sql => 'runs' }),
        AjaxScaffold::ScaffoldColumn.new(Report, { :name => "viewed", 
          :eval => "row.views", :sort_sql => 'views' }),
        AjaxScaffold::ScaffoldColumn.new(Report, { :name => "runtime (sec)", 
          :eval => "row.last_report_run.run_time", :sort_sql => 'method:last_report_run.run_time' })
      ]

end
